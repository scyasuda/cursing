# Oh #$&! Perceptions of a Cursing Robot
## Team Cursing
In this experiment, we investigate whether the violation of a social norm, cursing, by a robot influences a humanâ€™s perceptions of that robot. We found that participants were more likely to consider the robot to be anthropomorphic in the experimental group as compared to the control group. Most participants who experienced the curse were also likely to laugh following it. However, participants were not more likely to speak to the robot after it cursed, and did not therefore consider it to be more agential. This implies that while cursing may cause a robot to appear more human, it does not elicit a social response in humans.

### Running Our Nao Scripts
1. Install Naoqi 
2. Change ip.txt to point to Nao's IP on the same network as the computer
3. Navigate to the correct file (nao_scripts) and execute ./runNao.py from the terminal
4. Follow the prompts, including inputting participant ID
5. Choose a condition of the study. 
6. Choose the behavior you want Nao to execute. Type 'f' when you are ready for Nao to play
7. At every iteration of rock-paper-scissors, record the participant's response via the terminal prompt (r, p, or s)
8. It records the participant's rock-paper-scissors responses in the data folder in a text file with their ID.
