# cursing

In this experiment, we investigate whether the violation of a social norm, cursing, by a robot influences a humanâ€™s perceptions of that robot. We found that participants were more likely to consider the robot to be anthropomorphic in the experimental group as compared to the control group. Most participants who experienced the curse were also likely to laugh following it. However, participants were not more likely to speak to the robot after it cursed, and did not therefore consider it to be more agential. This implies that while cursing may cause a robot to appear more human, it does not elicit a social response in humans.
